# Tokenizer
a Web3 BNB Chain related exercise

## **New things ðŸ“š**

ðŸ”» **Web3**  
The web 3.0 is the concept of the next generation of the web, in which most users will be connected via a **decentralized network** and have access to their own data.

ðŸ”» **Dapps**  
Stands for **Decentralized** applications, built on peer-to-peer blockchain networks, open-source code

ðŸ”» **Token** ~ *a unique digital asset*  
A digital representation of an **asset** that has been issued on an existing blockchain  
Not **mined**, the quantity is determined by the issuer  
This **asset** doesn't necessarily have to be a unit of cryptocurrency; it could be a right to access a service, loyalty points, and so on  

ðŸ”» **Ticker**  
A short combination of letters that is used to represent an asset.
- ETH Ethereum
- BTC Bitcoin

ðŸ”» **BlockChain**  
enables **tokens** to be created, stored, transferred, and transacted in a real-time, immutable manneracross a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Anything of value can be tracked/traded virtually.

ðŸ”» **Whitepaper**  
The whitepaper is a **key ressource** document. Destined to investors, developers, researchers...  interested in understanding of a specific blockchain project. It Explain its workings, objectives, and underlying architecture, as well as to present potential use cases and benefits.

ðŸ”» **Smart contracts**  
A **self-executing program** on a blockchain. Written in blockchain-specific programming languages, such as **Solidity** for **Ethereum**. They are designed to **automatically execute** transactions or actions **when predefined conditions are met** in a secure and transparent manner. 

ðŸ”» **[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/fr/what-is-ethereum)**  

- Ethereum is a decentralized **blockchain** platform that enables the execution of **smart contracts** and the deployment of **DApps**.  

- Unlike **Bitcoin**, which is primarily designed to be a digital currency, Ethereum aims to provide a platform for the creation of autonomous contracts and decentralized applications through its own cryptocurrency called **Ether** (**ETH**).  

- Its smart contracts, can be utilized in various areas such as decentralized finance (**DeFi**), gaming, digital identities, voting systems.  

- Launched in 2015, it has become one of the most popular and widely used blockchain platforms.

ðŸ”» **[ERC-20](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/an-introduction-to-erc-20-tokens) & [BEP-20](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/bep-20) Tokens**
<br/>

## **Token creation**

> Creating and deploying **digital assets** in a **blockchain network**  
`Secure - immutable - efficient` &emsp; *Fungible or Non Fungible*

<br/>

ðŸ”» **Fungible Token** - *interchangeables, unique value, divisible*  

- **Utility** token  
provide access to a product or service  
- **Security** token  
represent the **ownership** of the underlaying asset or company  
*For example, if a security token represents a stake in a company, the company itself is the underlying asset.*

<br/>

ðŸ”» **Non Fungible Token** - *NFT unique, non interchangables*  
&emsp; represent the **ownership** of a **digital file** *art, audio, video ...*

<br/>

## **Blockchain**

> Blockchain is a **trustless**, **immutable**, **distributed** **ledger** of **information**

Component | Meaning
--- | :--
**`Trustless`** | Every party has a complete copy of the **ledger**.  No need trusting a third party.
**`Immutable`** | Data in the ledger is **locked**. Adding more is allowed but not editing/modify.
**`Distributed`** | Data is **decentralized**. Ledger is stored and duplicated across many systems in many places.
**`Information`** | Data + **metadata** of an object or action.

```Javascript
// The BlockChain, a chain composed of locked `blocks`
   [Block]-[Block]-[Block]  ...  <<  [NewBlock]
// They represent a complete record of all transactions
```

<br/>

## BlockChain Related pluggins, frameworks and tools

<br/>

ðŸ”» **Metamask** *Web browser extension & mobile app*

Access decentralized applications *`DApps`* on the **Ethereum** blockchain on browser (*Chrome often*).Users can manage their Ethereum accounts, send and receive Ether, as well as interact with **smart contracts** and **Dapps** directly from their browser. An easy access to the Ethereum ecosystem.  

- using a **secrete recovery phrase** to login aka **seed phrase** (12-24 words)
- Can connect to blockchains **networks**, started **Ethereum**, added then switched to **BNB chain**
- **BNB Smart Chain Testnet network**.  
Play around with fake money and get familiar with the wallet.
