ðŸ”» **Web3**  
The web 3.0 is the concept of the next generation of the web, in which most users will be connected via a **decentralized network** and have access to their own data.

<br/>

ðŸ”» **Dapps** & **DeFI**

**DApp** stands for **Decentralized applications**, built on peer-to-peer blockchain networks, open-source code  
**DeFI** stands for **Decentralized Finance**

<br/>


ðŸ”» **Solidity**

Solidity is the **programming language** most commonly used in blockchain and smart contracts. [ðŸ“‘](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.24/)

<br/>

ðŸ”» **Token** ~ *a unique digital asset*  
A digital representation of an **asset** that has been issued on an existing blockchain  
Not **mined**, the quantity is determined by the issuer  
This **asset** doesn't necessarily have to be a unit of cryptocurrency; it could be a right to access a service, loyalty points, and so on  

<br/>


ðŸ”» **Ticker**  
A short combination of letters that is used to represent an asset.
- ETH Ethereum
- BTC Bitcoin

<br/>


ðŸ”» **BlockChain**  
enables **tokens** to be created, stored, transferred, and transacted in a real-time, immutable manneracross a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Anything of value can be tracked/traded virtually.

<br/>


ðŸ”» **Whitepaper**  
The whitepaper is a **key ressource** document. Destined to investors, developers, researchers...  interested in understanding of a specific blockchain project. It Explain its workings, objectives, and underlying architecture, as well as to present potential use cases and benefits.

<br/>


ðŸ”» **Smart contracts**  
> Applications or programs that run on the blockchain

A **self-executing program** on a blockchain. Written in blockchain-specific programming languages, such as **Solidity** for **Ethereum**. They are designed to **automatically execute** transactions or actions **when predefined conditions are met** in a secure and transparent manner. 

<br/>


ðŸ”» **[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/fr/what-is-ethereum)**  

- Ethereum is a decentralized **blockchain** platform that enables the execution of **smart contracts** and the deployment of **DApps**.  

- Unlike **Bitcoin**, which is primarily designed to be a digital currency, Ethereum aims to provide a platform for the creation of autonomous contracts and decentralized applications through its own cryptocurrency called **Ether** (**ETH**).  

- Its smart contracts, can be utilized in various areas such as decentralized finance (**DeFi**), gaming, digital identities, voting systems.  

- Launched in 2015, it has become one of the most popular and widely used blockchain platforms.

- 1 ETH = 10^18 Wei, Wei is used as the smallest quantity of Ether to handle. 

<br/>

ðŸ”» **[Contract ABI Specification](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.25/abi-spec.html)**  

The Contract `A`pplication `B`inary `I`nterface is the standard way to interact with contracts in the Ethereum ecosystem, both from outside the blockchain and for contract-to-contract interaction. Data is encoded according to its type, as described in this specification.

> This ABI is a JSON file generated when `truffle compile` or `npx hardhat compile` in `build` folder.

ðŸ”» **[Metamask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531-Getting-started-with-MetaMask)**

**MetaMask** is a web browser extension and mobile app that allows you to manage your Ethereum private keys. By doing so, it serves as a **wallet** for Ether and other tokens, and allows you to interact with **decentralized applications**, or **dapps**.

**[RPC](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-network-RPC)**  
`R`emote `P`rocedure `C`all, a set of protocols that allow a client (such as MetaMask) to interact with a blockchain.

ðŸ”» **Stacking**  

To **stake** tokens means locking up coins to maintain the security of a blockchain network and earning rewards in return when selected as validators.  *Binance & Ethereum : Proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism*

<br/>

## **Token creation**

> Creating and deploying **digital assets** in a **blockchain network**  
`Secure - immutable - efficient` &emsp; *Fungible or Non Fungible*

<br/>

ðŸ”» **Fungible Token** - *interchangeables, unique value, divisible*  

- **Utility** token  
provide access to a product or service  
- **Security** token  
represent the **ownership** of the underlaying asset or company  
*For example, if a security token represents a stake in a company, the company itself is the underlying asset.*

<br/>

ðŸ”» **Non Fungible Token** - *NFT unique, non interchangables*  
&emsp; represent the **ownership** of a **digital file** *art, audio, video ...*
