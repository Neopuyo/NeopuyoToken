> Blockchain is a **trustless**, **immutable**, **distributed** **ledger** of **information**

Component | Meaning
--- | :--
**`Trustless`** | Every party has a complete copy of the **ledger**.  No need trusting a third party.
**`Immutable`** | Data in the ledger is **locked**. Adding more is allowed but not editing/modify.
**`Distributed`** | Data is **decentralized**. Ledger is stored and duplicated across many systems in many places.
**`Information`** | Data + **metadata** of an object or action.

```Javascript
// The BlockChain, a chain composed of locked `blocks`
   [Block]-[Block]-[Block]  ...  <<  [NewBlock]
// They represent a complete record of all transactions
```

\- ðŸ”³ **A** > `npx hardhat node`  
&emsp; *launch hardhat local network*  
\- ðŸ”³ **B** > `npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js`  
&emsp; *will see logs on other console A*  
&emsp; *check contract with npx hardhat [clean/compile/test] sequence before*  
\- **Frontend** -> `provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider('http://localhost:8545');`  
&emsp; *Don't forget open port 8545 in Docker*  
&emsp; *go check http://localhost:8545 will see : Parse error: Unexpected end of JSON input*  


## ðŸ”» **Metamask** *Web browser extension & mobile app*

Access decentralized applications *`DApps`* on the **Ethereum** blockchain on browser (*Chrome often*).Users can manage their Ethereum accounts, send and receive Ether, as well as interact with **smart contracts** and **Dapps** directly from their browser. An easy access to the Ethereum ecosystem.  

- using a **secrete recovery phrase** to login aka **seed phrase** (12-24 words)
- Can connect to blockchains **networks**, started **Ethereum**, added then switched to **BNB chain**
- **BNB Smart Chain Testnet network**.  
Play around with fake money and get familiar with the wallet.
