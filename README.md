## **New things üìö**

**Web3**  
The web 3.0 is the concept of the next generation of the web, in which most users will be connected via a **decentralized network** and have access to their own data.

**Dapps**  
Stands for **Decentralized** applications, built on peer-to-peer blockchain networks, open-source code

**Token** ~ *a unique digital asset*  
A digital representation of an **asset** that has been issued on an existing blockchain  
Not **mined**, the quantity is determined by the issuer  
This **asset** doesn't necessarily have to be a unit of cryptocurrency; it could be a right to access a service, loyalty points, and so on  

**BlockChain**  
enables **tokens** to be created, stored, transferred, and transacted in a real-time, immutable manneracross a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Anything of value can be tracked/traded virtually.
