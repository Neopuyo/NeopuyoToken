# Tokenizer
a Web3 BNB Chain related exercise

## **New things ðŸ“š**

ðŸ”» **Web3**  
The web 3.0 is the concept of the next generation of the web, in which most users will be connected via a **decentralized network** and have access to their own data.

ðŸ”» **Dapps**
Stands for **Decentralized** applications, built on peer-to-peer blockchain networks, open-source code

ðŸ”» **Token** ~ *a unique digital asset*  
A digital representation of an **asset** that has been issued on an existing blockchain  
Not **mined**, the quantity is determined by the issuer  
This **asset** doesn't necessarily have to be a unit of cryptocurrency; it could be a right to access a service, loyalty points, and so on  

ðŸ”» **BlockChain**  
enables **tokens** to be created, stored, transferred, and transacted in a real-time, immutable manneracross a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Anything of value can be tracked/traded virtually.

ðŸ”» **Whitepaper**  
The whitepaper is a **key ressource** document. Destined to investors, developers, researchers...  interested in understanding of a specific blockchain project. It Explain its workings, objectives, and underlying architecture, as well as to present potential use cases and benefits.

ðŸ”» **Smart contracts**  
A **self-executing program** on a blockchain. Written in blockchain-specific programming languages, such as **Solidity** for **Ethereum**. They are designed to **automatically execute** transactions or actions **when predefined conditions are met** in a secure and transparent manner. 

<br/>

## **Token creation**

> Creating and deploying **digital assets** in a **blockchain network**  
`Secure - immutable - efficient` &emsp; *Fungible or Non Fungible*

<br/>

ðŸ”» **Fungible Token** - *interchangeables, unique value, divisible*  

- **Utility** token  
provide access to a product or service  
- **Security** token  
represent the **ownership** of the underlaying asset or company  
*For example, if a security token represents a stake in a company, the company itself is the underlying asset.*

<br/>

ðŸ”» **Non Fungible Token** - *NFT unique, non interchangables*  
&emsp; represent the **ownership** of a **digital file** *art, audio, video ...*

<br/>

## **Blockchain**

> Blockchain is a **trustless**, **immutable**, **distributed** **ledger** of **information**

Component | Meaning
--- | :--
**`Trustless`** | Every party has a complete copy of the **ledger**.  No need trusting a third party.
**`Immutable`** | Data in the ledger is **locked**. Adding more is allowed but not editing/modify.
**`Distributed`** | Data is **decentralized**. Ledger is stored and duplicated across many systems in many places.
**`Information`** | Data + **metadata** of an object or action.

```Javascript
// The BlockChain, a chain composed of locked `blocks`
   [Block]-[Block]-[Block]  ...  <<  [NewBlock]
// They represent a complete record of all transactions
```

## **Blockchain Plateforms**

Chacun liÃ© Ã  une blockchain ?  
Est-ce que la Blockchain plateform du sujet c'est **BNB Chain** / **BNB Smart Chain** ? (BSC)  
C'est plutÃ´t liÃ© Ã  la section IDE ci-dessous ?

## **How to Tokenizer ?**

1. Read provided links and documentation, note keyword and their meaning in this README.md
2. Lets try to code something, using this BNB Chain tutorial
